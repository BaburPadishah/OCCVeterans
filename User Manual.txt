-----------------------
1. STARTING THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

Double-click the file named "Sign_In_Program.exe". 
The main window will be displayed, which contains:
	1. Directions for the user to enter their student ID
	2. The text box which allows users to enter their ID
	3. A button that can be clicked to sign in


-----------------------
2. REGISTER AS A MEMBER
-----------------------

Once the program is started, enter your student ID and press ENTER or
click the "Sign-In" button. The program will notify you that your ID was 
not found, and ask you if you wish to register as a new member.
Clicking "Yes" will display the New Member Registration window,
where you must enter your first name, last name, and your branch. 
While hyphens and apostrophes in names are supported, diacritic
marks are not. When you are finished, click the "Register" button at the
bottom of the window. Please note that you will not be able to click the 
"Register" button until you have entered your data. This will also count
as signing in.

3. SIGNING IN
-------------

To sign in, enter your student ID into the text box, and either press ENTER
or click the "Sign-In" button. The program will either confirm your sign in
if it recognizes your ID, or ask you if you wish to register as a new member
if it does not. 


----------------------------------------
4. SEARCHING RECORDS AS AN ADMINISTRATOR
----------------------------------------

Enter the administrator password into the main window's text box. The 
Member Search window will be displayed, containing two lists.

     1. Member List: To the left is a list of all current members, organized 
	alphabetically by name. Enter data in the fields above to search by 
	ID, name, branch, or any combination of those three.  Please note 
	that while hyphens and apostrophes in names are supported, diacritic 
	marks are not.
     2. Records List: To the right is a list of all sign ins that have 
	occurred in the selected time interval. Similar to the member
	list, you can search by ID and/or name. To view logins on a particular
	day, click on the date located next to "Search by Date" and select a 
	day from the calendar. Make sure the checkbox next to the date is 
	checked, then press the "Search Logins" button. If you don't wish to
	search for a particular day, uncheck the checkbox.

If any of the names are cut off by the column length, you can resize the 
columns by clicking and dragging the sides of their headers to the 
desired length. When finished searching, press the "Finish" button at the
bottom of the window.
